Designing Line buffers to be used as Input, Filter, Output buffers sorrounding a myriad of PEs that will perform FFT and Winograd based accelerated convolutions.
Since Convolutional Layer takes up 90% of the compute time in state of the art Nueral Networks, this optimizaiton is all the more important.
